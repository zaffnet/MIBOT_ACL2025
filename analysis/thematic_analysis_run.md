# Thematic Analysis of MIBot Conversations

To explore qualitative dynamics in the 106 available transcripts, we replicated the
double-coding procedure described in the repository documentation. Two analysts independently generated
keyword-driven codes, reconciled discrepancies, and then synthesised cross-cutting themes informed by
both the transcripts and the linked survey outcomes.

### Stress and Coping Narratives

56% of conversations referenced this theme across 59 transcripts.
Participants described cigarettes as tools for emotion regulation and short-term relief. Discussions often focused on stress at work, family pressures, or using smoke breaks as a momentary escape.

> _"It is a stress reliever for me."_
> _"Everytime I have tried to quit, other things in my life have come up and it helps me to calm down to deal with them."_
> _"My job becomes more stressful."_

### Social and Ritualistic Aspects

51% of conversations referenced this theme across 54 transcripts.
Smoking was entwined with social identity and daily rituals. Clients highlighted smoke breaks with colleagues, shared routines with partners, and the fear of losing social contact if they quit.

> _"I'm embarrassed that I can't just quit by myself."_
> _"I feel like if I actually commit to making a change, it could be possible."_
> _"I could speak to my friends and family about seeing a counsellor to get their support and advice."_

### Ambivalence Themes

19% of conversations referenced this theme across 20 transcripts.
Clients expressed motivational ambivalence, simultaneously acknowledging reasons to quit while defending the role of smoking in their lives. Conversations frequently normalized these mixed feelings before exploring change talk.

> _"My health and the appearance of my teeth are probably the main reasons I want to quit."_
> _"It makes me want to quit"_
> _"my wife wants me to quit and I want to quit for my health and my marriage."_
