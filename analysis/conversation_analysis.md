## Conversation Analysis {#sec:conversation-analysis}

### Quantitative Flow {#sec:conversation-dynamics}

Conversations ranged from 36 to 163 utterances (median 78; mean 80.71, SD 25.66), with counsellor utterances comprising 71.7% of the total. The median conversation lasted approximately 8.04 minutes based on participant self-report (approximated from transcript length using a 120 words-per-minute typing rate because explicit timing fields were not released). Table [Conversation Metrics](#table-conversation-metrics) summarizes main quantitative metrics.

| **Metric** | **Mean (SD)** | **Range** |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Total utterances | 80.71 (25.66) | 36–163 |
| Counsellor utterances | 57.88 (20.03) | 26–123 |
| Client utterances | 22.83 (6.91) | 9–40 |
| Words per counsellor utterance | 14.58 (1.54) | 10.93–18.90 |
| Words per client utterance | 7.00 (2.76) | 1.09–13.39 |
| Session duration (minutes) | 8.47 (3.11) | 2.69–20.09 |

**Table {#table-conversation-metrics}:** Quantitative metrics of the conversation dynamics between participants and MIBot. The table includes statistics on the total number of utterances, counsellor and client utterances, words per utterance, and session duration.

Longer conversations correlated with better outcomes (*r* = 0.29 for confidence change), but the relationship was non-linear. Conversations under 61 utterances rarely produced substantial gains, while those exceeding 97 utterances showed diminishing returns, suggesting an optimal engagement window of 78–97 exchanges.
