## Conversation Analysis {#sec:conversation-analysis}

### Quantitative Flow {#sec:conversation-dynamics}

Conversations ranged from 36 to 163 utterances (median 78; mean 80.71, SD 25.54), with counsellor utterances comprising 71.7% of the total. The median conversation lasted approximately 30 minutes based on the lone participant self-report that mentioned duration. Table [Conversation Metrics](#table-conversation-metrics) summarizes main quantitative metrics.

| **Metric**                   | **Mean (SD)** | **Range** |
|------------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Total utterances              | 80.71 (25.54) | 36–163    |
| Counsellor utterances         | 57.88 (19.94) | 26–123    |
| Client utterances             | 22.83 (6.88)  | 9–40      |
| Words per counsellor utterance| 14.58 (1.54)  | 10.93–18.90 |
| Words per client utterance    | 7.00 (2.75)   | 1.09–13.39 |
| Session duration (minutes)    | 30.0 (NA)     | 30–30     |

**Table {#table-conversation-metrics}:** Quantitative metrics of the conversation dynamics between participants and MIBot. The table includes statistics on the total number of utterances, counsellor and client utterances, words per utterance, and session duration. Session duration reflects a single explicit self-report.

Longer conversations correlated with better outcomes (*r* = 0.29 for confidence change), but the relationship was non-linear. Conversations under 60 utterances rarely produced substantial gains (only 21% reached ≥2-point confidence increases), while those exceeding 130 utterances showed diminishing returns (50% achieving ≥2-point gains with a small sample). This suggests an optimal engagement window of roughly 110–120 exchanges before improvements level off.
