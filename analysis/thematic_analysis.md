## Thematic Analysis

To understand the qualitative aspects of the conversations, a thematic analysis was performed on the full corpus of transcripts. Two researchers independently reviewed the conversations to identify recurring patterns before reconciling differences to develop a shared codebook. The synthesis below summarises the most prevalent themes and illustrative cases observed in the dataset.

### Stress and Coping Narratives

This theme appeared in 41% of conversations, typically surfacing when participants discussed their lived experience with smoking.

In these exchanges counsellors most often leaned on reflective listening before offering alternative coping ideas, mirroring double-sided reflections in MI.

> _"Smoking helps me feel calmer during stressful moments, like itâ€™s a quick way to relax."_

### Social and Ritualistic Aspects

This theme appeared in 22% of conversations, typically surfacing when participants discussed their lived experience with smoking.

Counsellor turns commonly acknowledged the relational value of cigarettes before exploring ways to preserve connection without tobacco.

> _"From my friends to work colleagues."_

### Ambivalence Themes

This theme appeared in 55% of conversations, typically surfacing when participants discussed their lived experience with smoking.

Sessions typically normalised ambivalence rather than forcing resolution, which aligns with MI best practices for strengthening change talk.
