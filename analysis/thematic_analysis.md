## Thematic Analysis {#sec:thematic-analysis}

To surface conversational patterns linked with therapeutic engagement, we combined lexical heuristics over all transcripts with readiness-ruler outcomes. Client-side utterances were scanned for smoking-related references aligned with stress, social context, and ambivalence lexicons, while survey deltas informed success and non-responder profiles.

This process revealed three recurring patterns:

\subsubsection{Stress and Coping Narratives}

The theme appeared in 19.8% of conversations, highlighting clients' narratives.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{"I think scheduling the walks could help a lot, especially if I can link them to the times when I usually smoke, like after meals or when I feel stressed in the evening."}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Social and Ritualistic Aspects}

The theme appeared in 20.8% of conversations, highlighting clients' narratives.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{"Yes, as much as smoking gives me an amazing satisfaction, at some point I feel bad because I know it's hindering my health and makes my friends and family sad."}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Ambivalence Themes}

The theme appeared in 48.1% of conversations, highlighting clients' narratives.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{"I think scheduling the walks could help a lot, especially if I can link them to the times when I usually smoke, like after meals or when I feel stressed in the evening."}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Success Stories}

The participant (5c387f7c...) entered with confidence 1.0/10 and reached 10.0/10 at one week (Δ 9.0). Their importance rating moved from 10.0 to 10.0 (Δ 0.0), across 123 utterances with 29 reflective responses.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Examined past quit attempts (5 mentions)
\item Reframed setbacks as learning moments (1 mentions)
\item Outlined a concrete quit plan (3 mentions)
\item Identified coping tools for anticipated triggers (1 mentions)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textit{"seeing underage kids smoke has made me see it in a negative light"}
\end{quote}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textit{"Perhaps you tell me how you would wish to help me as you have stated above."}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Non-Responders and Negative Cases}
Analysis of the 2 participants whose confidence decreased revealed three patterns:
\paragraph{Mandated Participation}
No participants exhibited this pattern in the current dataset.
\paragraph{Enjoyment-Focused Smokers}
1 participants met this pattern.
\begin{quote}
\textit{"I don't see them negatively as I am mindful of others and smoke at home, in my car, or in environments where many people smoke, e.g. a casino."}
