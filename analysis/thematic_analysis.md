## Thematic Analysis {#sec:thematic-analysis}

To understand the qualitative aspects of the conversations, a thematic analysis was performed on the full corpus of transcripts. Two researchers independently reviewed all utterances using the automated tooling below to surface recurring patterns before meeting to reconcile disagreements and agree on final themes that characterize successful and unsuccessful engagement.

\subsubsection{Stress and Coping Narratives}

This theme appeared in 53\% of conversations (56 of the analysed participants), typically involving Smoking framed as an emotional regulation tool.
MIBot tended to respond with Reflective listening that validates emotions before suggesting alternatives.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``I think scheduling the walks could help a lot, especially if I can link them to the times when I usually smoke, like after meals or when I feel stressed in the evening.''}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Social and Ritualistic Aspects}

This theme appeared in 43\% of conversations (46 of the analysed participants), typically involving Smoking anchored in shared routines, relationships, or rituals.
MIBot tended to respond with Exploring ways to preserve connection while adjusting routines.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``Yes, as much as smoking gives me an amazing satisfaction, at some point I feel bad because I know it's hindering my health and makes my friends and family sad.''}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Ambivalence Themes}

This theme appeared in 76\% of conversations (81 of the analysed participants), typically involving Simultaneous desire to quit and attachment to smoking.
MIBot tended to respond with Normalizing mixed feelings without forcing a resolution.

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``I guess psychologically I'm addicted to the chemicals in tobacco as well much as they nicotine so the NRT helped but I was always longing for a smoke,''}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Success Stories}

Participant 5c387f entered with confidence 1/10 and importance 10/10. Over 123 utterances the dialogue raised confidence to 9/10 (Δ 8).
Week-later follow-up recorded confidence at 10/10, increasing by an additional 1 point.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Developed a detailed, personalized quit plan.
\end{enumerate}

Participant 7a1297 entered with confidence 0/10 and importance 6/10. Over 82 utterances the dialogue raised confidence to 8/10 (Δ 8).
Week-later follow-up recorded confidence at 0/10, a decline of 8 points from session end.

\subsubsection{Non-Responders and Negative Cases}

Not all participants benefited equally. Among the participants whose confidence scores decreased after the session, three recurring patterns emerged: A total of 2 participants experienced declines in confidence.

\paragraph{Mandated Participation}
These conversations averaged 52 utterances with clients speaking 10 words per turn on average, suggesting transactional engagement.

\paragraph{Enjoyment-Focused Smokers}
A subset identified strongly as happy smokers; motivational exploration sometimes reinforced enjoyment.
\begin{quote}
	\textit{``Frankly, I enjoy it, and long ago I tried hypnosis and it worked; I found it distasteful.''}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Technical Therapeutic Mismatches}
In a few conversations, the agent emphasised change strategies while participants signalled emotional needs, resulting in missed attunement.
